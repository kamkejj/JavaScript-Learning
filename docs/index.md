# JavaScript Learning

## Delcaring Variables.
let, const and var

```let variable = 123;```
Defining with let you can later change the value (mutable). Has block scope.

```const var = 321;```
Defining with const the value can not be changed later (immutable).

let vs. const
Use const in most cases unless the value of the variable will in fact be changed at some point in the program.

```var variable = 456;```
Usr var should be avoided in modern ES6+ JavaScript.
Has global scope.

## Strings

Template literale.
In s string translate the variable to its value.

const name = "Bob";
```const bob = `${name}`;``` (use back ticks)
